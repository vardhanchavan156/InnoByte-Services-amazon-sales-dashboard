📊 Amazon Sales Performance Dashboard

This project is part of my internship with Innobyte Services.
It analyzes Amazon sales data (Jan–Apr 2025) using Python, MySQL, and Power BI to uncover actionable business insights on sales trends, fulfilment efficiency, customer behavior, and geographical performance.

    - Identify top product categories and customer purchasing patterns.

    - Evaluate fulfilment effectiveness (Amazon vs Merchant).

    - Segment customers (Unique, Repeat, B2B, High-value).

    - Explore geographical distribution of sales across states & cities.

    - Provide business insights & recommendations for optimization.

🔹 Tools & Technologies

    - Python – Data cleaning & preprocessing (handled missing values, duplicates, formatting).

    - MySQL – Structured storage & integration layer for scalability.

    - Power BI – Data visualization & interactive dashboard.
    
🔹 Data Preparation (Python)

    - Cleaned raw CSV dataset.
    - Fixed missing & inconsistent values.
    - Converted data types (dates, numerics).
    - Standardized categorical fields (Fulfilment, Status).
    - Exported cleaned data into MySQL.

🔹 Dashboard Pages (Power BI)
